The built-in autograder provides you with immediate feedback about the correctness of your code. You will spend most of your time using this built-in autograder functionality.\n2. **Submit to Autograder.** Using the autograder notebook to submit a completed lab exercise to the course autograder. The course autograder runs the exact same tests as the built-in notebook autograder. There is no advantage to submitting to the course autograder until your code passes as many built-in tests as you can.\n3. **Submit to edX.** Submitting the submission ID from the course autograder on the edX course website. Submitting your submission ID on the edX course website will record your score for the assignment. You should only need to do this step once, after you have completed a lab exercise.\n\n** You must complete _all_ three steps to receive a score for a lab assignment. **\n\nThis notebook will guide you through Steps 2 and 3 of this process.\n\n**You _must_ register with the autograder first.**\n\nIf you have not yet registered with the autograder, download a copy of [the autograder registration notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spark-mooc/mooc-setup/master/cs120_autograder_register.dbc) and follow the instructions.\n\n## A note on running this notebook\n\nYou can run a cell by pressing \"shift-enter\", which will compute the current cell and advance to the next cell, or by clicking in a cell and pressing \"control-enter\", which will compute the current cell and remain in that cell."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Section A: Put your registration token in the following cell\n\nThis notebook _will not work_ unless the following cell is filled properly.
